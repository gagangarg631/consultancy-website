      <p className="mb-4">
        At The MindSpace Centre, we believe mental health conversations shouldn’t feel heavy or complicated. Our workshops are simple, real, and designed to connect with people where they are — whether it's a school, college, workplace, or community group.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">We talk about things most people hesitate to discuss:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Why stress feels so exhausting.</li>
        <li>Why anxiety and overthinking are so common today.</li>
        <li>How to actually take care of your mind — not just hear about “self-care” as a buzzword.</li>
        <li>When feeling “not okay” is normal — and when you should seek help.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 mt-4">

            Our sessions aren’t lectures. They’re real conversations, mixed with activities and practical tips that people can actually use in daily life.
