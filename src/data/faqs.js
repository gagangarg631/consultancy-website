    question: "Is counselling only for people with serious mental illness?",

    question: "How much do sessions cost?",

    question: "How do I know if I or my family member needs counselling?",
    answer: "If someone feels constantly overwhelmed, emotionally stuck, confused about life decisions, or relationships feel strained, counselling can help. Don’t wait for things to worsen."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Can counselling fix relationship problems?",
    answer: "Counselling can help couples/families understand each other better, resolve misunderstandings, and learn to communicate healthily. But change depends on honest participation from both sides."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Do you give direct advice or solutions?",
    answer: "Not exactly. Counselling helps you understand your own thoughts and patterns. We guide, not instruct. Solutions are explored together, not imposed."
  },

    id: 6,
    question: "What is the difference between counselling and psychiatry?",
    answer: "Counselling focuses on emotions, thoughts, and behaviours through talk therapy. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who prescribe medicines. Often, both work together when needed."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer: "There’s no fixed answer. Some clients feel better in 4-5 sessions, others may continue for months. It depends on your needs and goals. You can discuss this openly anytime."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Is family or couple counselling about blaming one person?",
    answer: "No. It’s not about finding faults. It’s about understanding patterns that cause stress and learning healthier ways to respond as a unit."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Will you share my personal details with anyone?",
    answer: "Strictly no. Sessions are confidential as per professional ethics, unless there’s a risk of harm to self or others, which will be explained beforehand."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Can I do counselling online? Is it effective?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer both online and offline sessions. Many clients prefer online sessions due to comfort and privacy. Both are equally effective when done consistently."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "What age groups do you work with?",
    answer: "We provide counselling for children (above 8 years), adolescents, adults, couples, and families."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "Do I need to come with my spouse/family for sessions?",
    answer: "For family or couple counselling, it helps if both/all parties come together. But if one member is unwilling, individual counselling can still help you manage the situation."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "What language will counselling happen in?",
    answer: "Sessions are conducted in English or Hindi, as per your comfort. You're free to express in mixed language too — what matters is your ease, not grammar."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "I’m feeling anxious about sharing personal things — is that normal?",
    answer: "Completely normal. Many people feel hesitant in the first session. You’re not expected to share everything at once. Counselling moves at your pace."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: "What if my partner/family refuses to attend counselling?",
    answer: "That’s common. You can still come alone and work on yourself. Sometimes, change in one person shifts the entire family dynamic."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "Is counselling a one-time thing or regular?",
    answer: "Some come once for clarity, others come regularly. Ideally, 3-4 consistent sessions help build understanding before deciding to continue or pause."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    question: "What issues do you handle in family or couple counselling?",
    answer: "We handle communication gaps, trust issues, frequent arguments, emotional distance, parenting stress, conflicts with in-laws, and general relationship dissatisfaction."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    question: "I’ve never been to therapy — what should I expect in the first session?",
    answer: "Expect simple questions, gentle listening, and a non-judgemental space. First sessions are about understanding you, not pushing solutions."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    question: "Will counselling really change anything?",
    answer: "Change is possible when you’re open to reflect and work on yourself. Counselling isn’t magic, but it’s a safe start towards understanding and healing."
